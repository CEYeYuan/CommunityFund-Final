# CommunityFund-Final
CommunityFund is a crowd funding platform for raising fund and awareness on community projects.
Crowdfunding1
is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions
from a large number of people, typically via the Internet. CrowdFunding has three main actors:
the project initiator who proposes the idea and/or project to be funded; individuals or groups who
support the idea; and a platform that brings the parties together. Since, crowdfunding leverage the
power of internet, anyone from anywhere in the world can fund any project. However, CommunityFund
is a community based crowed funding platform where people would fund community-based
projects. So both the fund-er and the project initiator has to be part of a same community. A
community can be based on interests or geographical locations. CrowdFunding is an example of
a sharing economy paradigm2, a socio-economic system built around the sharing of human and
physical resources
